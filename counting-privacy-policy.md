# Privacy Policy


Welcome! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect and share your personal information through our Services.

Please read the following Privacy Policy carefully and thoroughly, and do not use our Applications or Discord Communities with the Application unless you agree to these terms.

In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use also apply. You can access them here: ToS.

Definitions
When we refer to "developers", "us" or "we", we mean the developers of the offered products.

When we refer to "Service" or "Application", we mean the products published by the developers.

When we refer to "Discord", we mean Discord Inc, located at 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

The meaning of the words does not differ or change by the use of plural or singular.

Data collected by us
As described below, our Services receive, process, or store content (including, but not limited to, metadata and/or message content) that they receive through the Discord API or other means of transmission, according to the respective settings of registered Discord communities. Transmission may occur, as appropriate, through the use of so-called Commands, sending messages in Discord channels accessible to Discord Bot, or sharing Content with Developers.

- Discord Community IDs: The Discord Community ID of Discord communities that use our applications may be stored and associated with data provided by the owners or administrators of the community. This includes Discord channel IDs, Discord role IDs, and other provided setting options, such as a Discord community's preferred language.

- Statistics: Depending on the settings and wishes of the owners or administrators of a Discord community, the number of messages on Discord in a specified Discord channel is stored and evaluated with their timestamp.

- Temporarily Stored Content: While our services are in operation, all types of messages or Discord communities with their owners and the number of members or error messages are temporarily stored, if applicable. This is for analysis purposes and is necessary for the full provision of our applications. This data is completely deleted when the applications are restarted.

- Discord ID - Blacklist: To protect our applications, we may store Discord IDs (for example, of Discord users or Discord communities) to exclude them from using the Services. 

- Statistics on use of the Services: We store the number of Discord Commands executed. This is not linked to Discord communities.

- Some features of the application may be used to create leaderboards of Discord communities or users. The application only receives the data for the leaderboards via channels defined by server moderators. These leaderboards can be accessed by users through a public command of the application and usually contain the names of various Discord communities or users as well as the data represented in the leaderboard, such as the score and the rank. Normally, the leaderboards are reset after a period of time specified in the command (for example weekly). This deletes the specified data from the database.

- "top.gg" user data: For some of our Services, you have the option to leave what is called an "upvote" on the top.gg website, https://top.gg/, every 12 hours. This is voluntary and may allow you to access additional features of our services. We share the content transmitted by top.gg with the provider https://webhook-topgg.com/, via which we receive the upvotes. These two providers are subject to their own terms and conditions, available at: top.gg: https://top.gg/terms and webhook-topgg: https://webhook-topgg.com/tos.html . Please contact these two providers (top.gg: support@top.gg, webhook-topgg: support@webhook-topgg.com) with any questions regarding upvotes. We will link and store your Discord ID with information about your upvotes, such as the time of your last upvote and statistics about your upvotes, among other things. 

What we use your data for
- Provision of Services. We use your data to provide you with our services.

- Backup copies. We may store your data as a so-called "backup copy".

How your data is shared
- In Discord itself. When you use our services in Discord communities, data stored there may be reflected in the form of a message or similar type of transmission. Who can access this data is determined by who has access to a particular community. Server owners or administrators set these permissions and determine whether a server requires an invitation link or is open and accessible to anyone. And these permissions, like the size of the server, can change over time. 

- With our provider. Data is shared with our hosting provider, Hetzner GmbH, where our services are also hosted. Hetzner GmbH's Terms of Use (https://www.hetzner.com/legal/terms-and-conditions) and Privacy Policy (https://www.hetzner.com/legal/privacy-policy) apply in addition to these Terms.

- Some features of the application may be used to create leaderboards of Discord communities or users. These leaderboards can be accessed by users through a public command of the application and usually contain the names of various Discord communities or users as well as the data represented in the leaderboard, such as the score and the rank.

- "Top.gg" and "webhook-topgg". For some of our services, you have the option to leave a so-called "upvote" on the website of top.gg, https://top.gg/, every 12 hours. This is voluntary and may allow you to access additional features of our services. We share the content transmitted by top.gg with the provider https://webhook-topgg.com/, via which we receive the upvotes. These two providers are subject to their own terms and conditions, available at: top.gg: https://top.gg/terms and webhook-topgg: https://webhook-topgg.com/tos.html . Please contact these two providers (top.gg: support@top.gg, webhook-topgg: support@webhook-topgg.com) if you have any questions regarding the upvotes. 

Duration of storage
- Discord Community Data. Unless otherwise stated, we retain data stored by and about you until it is deleted by server owners or administrators. This can be triggered by the command of a service in a Discord community itself or by a request through our contact options.

- User Data. Unless otherwise specified, we retain data stored by and about you until it is deleted. The deletion can be the case through the command of a service itself or through a request via our contact options.



Copies of the stored data may be made for testing purposes or to prepare updates of the service and deleted after the period of time required for the specified purposes.

We reserve the right to delete data without giving reasons.

In the event of a permanent cessation of the operation of the application, the data will also be deleted without you having to advocate for its deletion.

How we protect your data
We will always try to protect your data. Access to the data is protected by several security measures and passwords. Nevertheless, we can not guarantee 100% protection.

Changes to this privacy policy
We will update this privacy policy as we add features to our services. We always indicate the date of the last update. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for updates. Use of our Services or participation in Discord communities after a change is made will automatically be considered acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

The last change took place on January 9, 2023 and is effective as of January 12, 2023.
